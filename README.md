# mDPI-Processing
 Code and example data for processing mDPI sensor data and plotting distributions

This repository includes code for:
1) Reading in raw sensor data on the mDPI compact vehicle, in .txt or .csv format, and combining into one large .csv file
2) Matching sensor data to a list of full frame images from the mDPI to generate oceanographic variables associated with each image
3) Merging identified image segments (i.e., zooplankton) to their nearest sensor data and plotting vertical distributions.

The folder ExampleData has the files needed to run a test and look at the data from one station sampled on August 10, 2021
